# Welcome to Hacktoberfest 2019  
## Contributing Guidelines  
Hello everyone, welcome to the bonus repo for completing your hacktoberfest 2019. I request you to make sure you add your code into the folder with the language name.  
There should not be more than one "hello worlds". If there exists a hello world, kindly create some other program may be swap two numbers or anything.  
A user can create upto 4 pull requests at max. Because, leave some pull requests for others too.  
### DO NOT BE LAZY AND MAKE THE CHANGES OVER README OR CONTRIBUTING!  
Many pull requests untill now were merged and accepted or closed without reporting. However, not meeting contributing guidelines will result in reporting the pull request.  
  
  
Please note that these guidelines are made in order to ease the merging and repo maintenance.  
  
Happy Hacking from Team SSIS!
